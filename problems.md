## 🏗️ Technical Debt & Architecture Concerns

### **TD-001: Firebase Vendor Lock-in Risk** 🟠
**Category:** Architecture Concern  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Description:** Heavy reliance on Firebase ecosystem could make migration difficult if costs scale or features become limiting.

**Potential Issues:**
- Firestore NoSQL limitations for complex queries
- Pricing model may become expensive at scale
- Limited backend customization options
- Vendor dependency for critical features

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Document data models in portable formats
- Use Firebase through abstraction layers where possible
- Plan migration strategies to alternatives (Supabase, custom backend)
- Monitor usage and costs regularly
- Keep business logic separate from Firebase-specific code

**Review Trigger:** When reaching 10,000+ active users or $200/month Firebase costs

### **TD-002: Manual Data Curation Scalability** 🟢
**Category:** Process Debt  
**Impact:** Low (for MVP phase)  
**Description:** Manual location curation won't scale to multiple cities without automation or team growth.

**Current Approach:**
- Hand-curating 100-200 locations per city
- Manual research and data entry
- No automated data validation
- Single person content management

**Future Challenges:**
- Time-intensive process for each new city
- Inconsistent data quality without standardization
- Difficult to keep information current
- Requires local knowledge for authentic curation

**Automation Path:**
- Build admin tools for content management
- Integrate selective API usage for data validation
- Develop community contribution features
- Create automated data freshness checks

**Action Trigger:** When expanding beyond 2-3 pilot cities

### **TD-003: Simple Recommendation Algorithm** 🟢
**Category:** Feature Debt  
**Impact:** Low (acceptable for MVP)  
**Description:** Basic tag-matching recommendation system lacks sophistication compared to AI-powered alternatives.

**Current Implementation:**
- Simple if/then rules based on user tags
- No learning from user behavior
- Static recommendation scoring
- No personalization beyond basic preferences

**Limitations:**
- May feel generic compared to AI-powered competitors
- No adaptation based on user feedback
- Limited understanding of user context and preferences
- Cannot learn from collective user behavior patterns

**AI Upgrade Path:**
- Collect user interaction data (views, saves, ratings)
- Implement collaborative filtering algorithms
- Add machine learning for pattern recognition
- Develop contextual awareness (time, weather, location)

**Success Criteria for Upgrade:** When basic recommendations show <60% user satisfaction

### **TD-004: Command System Maintenance** 🟢
**Category:** Process Management  
**Impact:** Low (manageable for solo developer)  
**Description:** The new command system requires maintenance as the project evolves and new needs emerge.

**Current Approach:**
- 20+ commands with individual specification files
- Commands cover daily workflow, problem-solving, and project management
- Integration across all documentation files
- Designed for solo developer with no coding background

**Potential Maintenance Challenges:**
- Commands may need updates as project phases change
- New commands may be needed for unforeseen situations
- AI assistants may interpret commands differently over time
- Command specifications may become outdated

**Maintenance Strategy:**
- Regular review of command effectiveness during weekly planning
- Update command specifications based on actual usage patterns
- Add new commands when gaps are identified
- Deprecate unused or ineffective commands
- Keep command documentation synchronized with project evolution

**Success Metrics:**
- Commands reduce time to get appropriate AI help
- Consistent quality of AI responses across sessions
- Reduced friction in daily development workflow
- Documentation stays current automatically

**Review Trigger:** When commands stop providing value or responses become inconsistent

### **TD-005: Over-Reliance on AI Assistance** 🟢
**Category:** Learning and Development Risk  
**Impact:** Low (acceptable trade-off for solo developer)  
**Description:** Heavy reliance on AI commands and assistance might limit independent problem-solving skill development.

**Current Approach:**
- Commands designed to explain concepts, not just provide solutions
- Built-in learning progression from guided to independent work
- Emphasis on understanding "why" not just "how"
- Safety net approach rather than replacement for thinking

**Potential Concerns:**
- May develop dependency on AI guidance for simple tasks
- Could limit creative problem-solving development
- Might miss learning opportunities from struggling through problems
- Risk of not developing debugging and research skills

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Commands emphasize learning and explanation over solution-giving
- Progressive reduction of AI assistance as skills develop
- Encourage experimentation and trying solutions before asking for help
- Include commands that promote independent thinking (`/Research`, `/Compare`)
- Plan transition points where AI assistance is gradually reduced

**Balance Indicators:**
- User can explain what their code does and why
- Increasing time between needing AI assistance
- User starts suggesting solutions before asking for help
- Growing confidence in making technical decisions independently

**Review Trigger:** When user expresses frustration with AI dependency or shows signs of learned helplessness

**Description:** No accessibility testing or guidelines established yet.

**Areas to Address:**
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- Focus management in single-page app
- Alternative text for images and maps

- Implement skip links and focus management
- Ensure minimum color contrast ratios
- Add accessibility linting rules

**Timeline:** Integrate during initial component development

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### **PC-001: Map Performance Planning** 🟠
**Category:** Performance Planning  
**Impact:** Medium (could affect UX)  
**Description:** Google Maps with many markers could impact performance on mobile devices.

**Potential Issues:**
- Slow rendering with 100+ location markers
- High memory usage on mobile devices
- Network requests for map tiles and data
- Battery drain during extended map usage

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Implement marker clustering for dense areas
- Use lazy loading for off-screen content
- Cache map tiles for offline usage
- Optimize image sizes and formats
- Implement viewport-based marker loading

**Testing Plan:**
- Test on low-end Android devices
- Measure battery usage during map sessions
- Monitor memory usage with many markers
- Test network performance on slow connections

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **SC-001: API Key Exposure Risk** 🟡
**Category:** Security Planning  
**Impact:** High (potential cost/usage abuse)  
**Description:** Google Maps API key could be exposed in client-side code.

**Risk Factors:**
- API keys visible in browser developer tools
- Potential unauthorized usage and billing
- Difficulty in rotating keys after exposure
- Rate limiting bypass possibilities

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use API key restrictions (HTTP referrers, IP addresses)
- Implement backend proxy for sensitive API calls
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Set up billing alerts and usage caps
- Plan key rotation procedures

**Implementation Priority:** Before deploying to production
