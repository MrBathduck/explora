# üöÄ Explora Solo Developer Implementation Guide

## üë§ Context: Solo "Vibe Coder" Constraints
- **Reality Check:** You're building this alone initially, no team to hire
- **Skill Level:** Vibe coder (not professional developer/designer)
- **Resources:** Limited time and budget for external help
- **Goal:** Build a functional MVP while maintaining the bigger vision

## üéØ Phase 1: Ultra-Lean Solo MVP (Months 1-8)

### **What to Build First (Pick 2-3 max)**
1. **Location Discovery with Basic Tags**

2. **Basic Mood Matcher**
   - 4 simple moods: Relaxed, Energetic, Cultural, Adventurous
