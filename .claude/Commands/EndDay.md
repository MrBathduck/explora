## 💡 Context Preservation Strategies

### **For Coding Sessions:**
```
🔧 Development Handoff:
Current Task: Adding Google Maps integration to LocationCard component
File: src/components/LocationCard.jsx (line 45)
Status: Successfully imported Google Maps API, working on marker placement
Next: Implement click handler for map markers
Error Context: Getting "API key not found" - need to check .env file tomorrow

Quick Start Tomorrow:
1. Open LocationCard.jsx
2. Check .env.local file for GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
3. Test marker click functionality
4. If working, move to next component integration
```

### **For Learning Sessions:**
```
📚 Learning Handoff:
Concept: Understanding React hooks and state management
Progress: Mastered useState, working on useEffect
Breakthrough: Finally understood component lifecycle!
Next: Practice useEffect with API calls
Resources: Bookmarked React docs section on hooks

Tomorrow's Focus:
1. Review useEffect examples from today
2. Try implementing API call in practice component
3. If comfortable, start integrating into main app
```

### **For Problem-Solving Sessions:**
```
🔍 Problem-Solving Handoff:
Issue: Firebase authentication not working properly
Investigation: Checked config, API keys, security rules
Discovery: Problem might be in redirect URL configuration
Tried: 3 different approaches, documented in code comments
Next: Need to research Firebase Auth redirect patterns

Tomorrow's Approach:
1. Review Firebase Auth documentation (bookmarked)
2. Check redirect URL settings in Firebase console
3. Test with simplified auth flow
4. Ask on Stack Overflow if still stuck
```
