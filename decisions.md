## üèóÔ∏è Initial Architecture Decisions

### **ADR-004: MVP Feature Prioritization**

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Solo developer phase, limited development time  

#### Context
With hundreds of potential features identified in research, I needed clear criteria for what to build first. The challenge was balancing user value, technical feasibility, and competitive differentiation within a 6-month timeline.

#### Decision
Priority framework based on:
1. **Core user journey:** Location discovery ‚Üí Itinerary building ‚Üí Trip execution
2. **Technical simplicity:** Prefer simple implementations over complex algorithms
3. **Unique value:** Features that differentiate from Google Maps/TripAdvisor
4. **Validation potential:** Features that generate clear user feedback

**MVP Feature Set:**
- Location database (100-200 curated spots per city)
- Tag-based filtering (Culture, Food, Nature, etc.)
- Simple itinerary builder with drag-and-drop
- Basic route optimization
- Offline access via PWA
- Google Maps integration

**Explicitly Excluded from MVP:**
- AI/ML recommendation engine
- Real-time crowd data
- Community features and reviews
- Multi-user collaboration
- Complex personalization algorithms

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear scope prevents feature creep
- Achievable timeline for solo developer
- Focus on core value proposition
- Faster user validation and feedback

**Negative:**
- Limited differentiation without AI features
- May appear basic compared to established apps
- Risk of users expecting more advanced features

**Neutral:**
- Success depends on execution quality of basic features
- Must communicate MVP status clearly to early users

#### Implementation Notes
- Document excluded features for future phases
- Create user feedback system to validate priorities
- Design architecture to accommodate future feature additions
- Set clear success metrics for MVP before adding complexity

### **ADR-005: Data Strategy - Manual Curation vs. API Integration**

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Solo developer phase, cost consciousness  

#### Context
Location data is crucial for the app, but API costs can be significant. Google Places API costs $17 per 1,000 calls, and terms restrict data storage. I needed a sustainable approach for initial development while planning for scale.

#### Decision
**Phase 1 (MVP):** Manual curation approach
- Hand-curate 100-200 locations per pilot city
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build internal content management system
- Use local knowledge and research for authentic recommendations

**Phase 2 (Scale):** Hybrid approach
- Maintain curated core content
- Supplement with selective API usage
- Community contributions for expansion
- Automated data validation and updates

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Zero API costs during MVP development
- Higher quality, more authentic recommendations
- No vendor lock-in or terms of service restrictions
- Aligns with "hidden gems" positioning
- Scalable through community contributions

**Negative:**
- Time-intensive manual research and data entry
- Limited coverage compared to comprehensive APIs
- Requires local knowledge for each new city
- May lag behind real-time changes (hours, closures)

**Neutral:**
- Creates unique content that competitors can't easily replicate
- Requires clear processes for data quality and updates

#### Implementation Notes
- Create standardized location data entry templates
- Build simple admin interface for content management
- Establish data quality criteria and review processes
- Plan community contribution features for future phases
- Document local research methods for scaling to new cities

### **ADR-006: Command-Based AI Interaction System**

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Solo developer phase, AI-assisted development workflow  

#### Context
As a solo "vibe coder" with no prior programming experience, I needed a way to communicate efficiently with AI assistants without having to explain context repeatedly or struggle with how to ask for help. Traditional AI interaction requires understanding how to phrase questions properly, which is a skill in itself.

#### Decision
Implement a comprehensive command system with 20+ predefined commands that:
- Provide instant context to AI assistants about project status and needs
- Eliminate the need to re-explain the project or current situation
- Give structured, consistent responses appropriate for beginners
- Automate documentation updates and progress tracking
- Create a safety net for common development challenges

**Core Command Categories:**
- **Daily Workflow:** `/StartDay`, `/Status`, `/TaskCompleted`, `/NextTask`, `/Concerns`
- **Problem-Solving:** `/Stuck`, `/Help`, `/Explain`
- **Progress Tracking:** `/Progress`, `/Update`, `/Skills`, `/Celebrate`
- **Planning:** `/WeeklyPlan`, `/Learn`, `/Research`, `/Compare`
- **Quality Assurance:** `/Review`, `/MobileCheck`, `/Performance`
- **Support:** `/Motivation`, `/Break`, `/Backup`, `/Deploy`

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Dramatically reduces friction in AI-assisted development
- Ensures consistent, beginner-appropriate responses
- Automates tedious documentation maintenance tasks
- Provides built-in safety net for common challenges
- Scales learning curve appropriately for skill development
- Creates repeatable workflow that builds confidence

**Negative:**
- Initial time investment to create comprehensive command system
- Requires AI assistant to understand and follow command specifications
- May create dependency on structured interaction patterns
- Commands need maintenance as project evolves

**Neutral:**
- Represents a new approach to AI-assisted development workflows
- May be useful template for other solo developer projects
- Could evolve into more sophisticated development assistance tools

#### Implementation Notes
- Each command has detailed specification file in `.claude/commands/` folder
- Commands designed to work with any AI assistant given proper context
- Vibe Coder Daily Guide updated to integrate commands throughout workflow
- All existing documentation updated to reference appropriate commands
- Success depends on consistent use and AI assistant adherence to specifications

### **ADR-007: Claude Code Integration for Development**

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** Solo developer phase, transition from documentation to active development  

#### Context
Moving from documentation phase to active development requires more direct code interaction. Claude Code provides terminal-based AI assistance for hands-on coding work, while web Claude remains valuable for strategic planning and comprehensive documentation.

#### Decision
Adopt a **hybrid development approach**:
- **Claude Code CLI:** Primary tool for hands-on development, file editing, debugging, and coding tasks
- **Web Claude:** Continue using for documentation updates, strategic planning, and comprehensive guidance
- **Command System:** Maintain compatibility across both environments
- **Context Handoff:** Seamless transition between environments with maintained project state

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Direct AI assistance while coding in the terminal
- Faster development iteration cycles with real-time help
- Seamless file manipulation and editing capabilities
- Maintained documentation quality through web Claude
- Unified command system works in both environments
- Enhanced learning experience with contextual coding assistance

**Negative:**
- Need to manage context across two interfaces
- Slight learning curve for Claude Code CLI usage
- Potential workflow complexity during environment transitions
- Commands may behave differently in each environment

**Neutral:**
- Requires updates to project documentation and workflow guides
- Represents evolution of AI-assisted development practices
- May become template for other solo developer projects

#### Implementation Notes
- Updated CLAUDE.md with Claude Code integration context
- Added Claude Code setup instructions to README.md
- Maintained existing command system for both environments
- Ensured seamless context transfer between web and CLI interfaces
