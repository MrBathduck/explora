## 📊 Priority Assessment Framework

### **How to Prioritize New Tasks**

#### **High Priority (This Week)**
- Blocks other development work
- Required for next milestone
- High impact on user experience
- Simple to implement with current skills

#### **Medium Priority (Next 2 Weeks)**
- Enables future feature development
- Moderate learning curve required
- Good return on time investment
- Aligns with MVP scope

#### **Low Priority (Someday/Maybe)**
- Nice to have but not essential
- Requires significant learning or research
- Can be implemented after user validation
- Advanced features beyond MVP scope

### **Task Evaluation Questions**
1. **Does this directly solve a user problem?**
2. **Is this required before other tasks can be completed?**
3. **Can this be implemented with current skills and tools?**
4. **Will this help validate the core product hypothesis?**
5. **Is this the simplest solution that could work?**

### **Potential Upcoming Blockers**
- **Google Maps API Billing:** Need to set up billing account for API usage
- **Firebase Limits:** Free tier limitations may require paid plan
- **Design Skills:** May need design assistance for polished UI
- **Content Creation:** Manually curating location data is time-intensive

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Keep API usage minimal during development
- Monitor Firebase usage and plan upgrade triggers
- Use component libraries and design systems for consistency
- Start with one city and proven curation methods
